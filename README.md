#Buzzview

====

This is an attempt to use the [HTML5 Vibrate API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Vibration_API) to vibrate a phone as you drag your finger over an image, to "feel" the image. 

However, it doesn't seem like we can vary the intensity of the vibration. Maybe it's possible to pulse it for very very short periods of time? 

MIT licensed; feel free to try and refine this a bit, but it's kind of fun already:
